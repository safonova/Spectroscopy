# Spectroscopy
Code that helps identify chemical elements from simple spectroscopy data.

Includes a csv file of all possible spectral lines and their wavelengths in angstroms.

Tips:
--Improving the calibration of your spectrometer should reduce margin of error and provide you with a shorter list of elements.
--The minimum intensity can be adjusted to exclude elements that are too faint to be observed by eye.
--Once you have a narrowed-down list, you can compare the spectra of the possible elements with that of the unknown gas to narrow it down by eye.
